# Turtle Crossing Game

## Description

This project is my impletmentation of the Turtle Crossing Game built using Python's turtle module. The objective of the game is to help the hero (a turtle) cross multiple lanes of traffic without getting hit by cars. As the hero successfully crosses all lanes, the game progresses to the next level, increasing the speed of the cars and the challenge.

## Features

Multiple Levels: The game includes multiple levels, with each level increasing in difficulty as the speed of the cars increases.
Random Car Generation: Cars are generated at random intervals, adding an element of unpredictability to the game.
Collision Detection: The game detects collisions between the hero and the cars, ending the game if a collision occurs.
Resource Management: Efficient management of car objects to prevent memory overflow.
